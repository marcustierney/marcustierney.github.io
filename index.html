      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm a game developer with a focus in systems, combat and UX/UI design. I enjoy working across multiple
        engines and tools, and I'm especially interested in gameplay programming, systems design, and UX/UI design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently a 4th year Computer Science: Game Design B.S. student at University of California, Santa Cruz. I've worked with Unity, Unreal Engine, and web-based frameworks.I love
        tackling problems that blend technical challenges with creative design.
