        Third person package delivery game where the player must navigate mountain terrain while avoiding obstacles and racing against the clock to deliver packages.
      </p>

      <p><strong>Team:</strong> Worked with a team of 5 people.</p>
      <p><strong>Responsibilities:</strong> Implemented climbing and grapple mechanics, random player spawn points, and procedural mesh generation.</p>
      <p><strong>Tech:</strong> Unity, C#</p>

        <h2><strong>Summary of Contributions</strong></h2>
          <h3><em>Implemented Climbing and Grapple Mechanics</em></h3>
          <p>Designed and implemented climbing and grapple mechanics to enhance player movement and navigation.</p>
          <p>Created a system for detecting climbable surfaces and implementing climbing interactions.</p>
          <p>Developed a grapple mechanic that allows players to swing across gaps and reach otherwise inaccessible areas.</p>
          <h3><em>Random Player Spawn Points</em></h3>
          <p>Implemented a system for randomly spawning the player at different locations on the map to increase replayability and challenge.</p>
          <p>Ensured that spawn points were strategically placed to provide a balanced gameplay experience.</p>
          <h3><em>Procedural Mesh Generation</em></h3>
          <p>Created a procedural mesh generation system to dynamically generate terrain and obstacles in the game world.</p>
          <p>Implemented algorithms for generating realistic mountain terrain and obstacles that fit the game's aesthetic and gameplay requirements.</p>

      <h1>What I Learned</h1>
          <h3><em>Procedural Mesh Generation is Hard</em></h3>
          <p>Implementing procedural mesh generation was a significant challenge that required an understanding of 3D geometry, algorithms, and optimization techniques.</p>
          <p>It involved using complex algorithms to generate terrain and obstacles that were both visually appealing and functional within the game world.</p>
          <p>I learned how to optimize the mesh generation process to ensure smooth performance while maintaining the desired level of detail.</p>
          <h3><em>Collaboration and Communication are Key</em></h3>
          <p>Working with a team of 5 people highlighted the importance of effective collaboration and communication in game development.</p>
          <p>Regular meetings, clear documentation, and open communication channels were essential for coordinating our efforts and ensuring that everyone was on the same page throughout the development process.</p>
          <p>For example, initally one of my teammates was responsible for the mesh generation. However as I was responsible for the player movement mechanics and randomly spawning, I had to integrate and adapt their work to fit within our overall game design. Thus I ended up collaborating with my teammate to synchronize the mesh generation.</p>
          <p>Through this experience, I learned how to effectively collaborate with others, share ideas, and resolve conflicts to create a cohesive and successful game.</p>
