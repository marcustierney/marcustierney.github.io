      <h1>What I Learned</h1>
          <h3><em>First Time Using a 3d Game Engine</em></h3>
          <p>Going into this project, I had no experience with 3D game engines. </p>
          <p>I had no idea what line tracing, nav meshes, static meshs, or how to give my objects physics properties.</p>
          <p>I couldn't even figure out how to write the gitignore file to get my project into github until much later than it should have been.</p>
          <p>I had many trial and error moments throughout the development process. But step by step, I learned and built my mental map of understanding the game engine which made my proceeding games in both Unreal and Unity much easier.</p>
          <h3><em>Why Programming is Easier Than Blueprints</em></h3>
          <p>I assumed the blueprint system would be easier because I could visualize my logic.</p>
          <p>However, this turned out to be completely wrong when dealing with many different interactions and lists, wires were entangled and hard to trace.</p>
          <p>Debugging became time-consuming and very very frustrating.</p>
          <p>In the future, I'll use blueprints for simple UI interactions and visual logic, but prefer C# for complex systems. I now know to use more public variables and split the blueprint logic into different function graphs.</p>
        <p><em>Blueprint logic (I am well aware this looks atrocious)</em></p>
